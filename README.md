Hi, I am cuervob69, and I am an enthusiast of technology, especially new ones, but I also love to discuss technology and its implications for human beings, so I'm not as a geek o a techie precisely, and rather I think of myself more as a thinker of human realities from all perspectives, taking the philosophical, scientific and technological frameworks as a reference in my thought.

Most of my experience with technology is in analytics as it's the field of technology that call my attention the most. In this sense, I am a data scientist or data analyst. As I approach things more scientifically than technically I am more the former than the latter.

I have knowledge and experience in descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics applied to activities and projects that matter to business and/or research.

Among these, there is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where I deal with frequency distributions, central tendency and dispersion measures, and data visualization, and Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA), where I tackle hypothesis testing and significance validation measures.

There are also all that have to do with machine learning, like supervise learning, with algorithms like linear and logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees and random forest, naive Bayes and support vector machines, and non-supervised learning, with algorithms like k-means, Gaussian mixture model and hierarchical clustering, among others, also neural networks and deep learning.

And last but not least, Big Data and data mining, where I face cloud base infrastructure and platforms, data management, architecture, and governance.

As a thinker of human problems and their solutions from the scientific point of view, my approach to analytic endeavors is that of taking into account every possible aspect that might affect them: the user (front end) as well as the developer (back end), data-driven decision-making as well as environmental sustainability, business profit as well as Business Process Organization (BPO), just to put some examples.

Whether your organization needs a data scientist or a data analyst, you can count on me. Bye!
